<&| /_elements/wrapper, title => 'Get SD' &>

<p>At this early stage of the game, you should probably download SD directly from its home in Subversion.</p>
<p>Before you install SD, you'll need to <a href="/prophet/download">install Prophet</a>.
</p>
<p>The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>svn co http://code.bestpractical.com/bps-public/sd/trunk sd</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you've downloaded SD, you can install it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>cd sd
PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the hopefully unlikely event that SD doesn't pass its tests, please <a href="/contact">tell the developers about it</a> so we can improve things.
</p>
