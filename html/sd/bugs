<&|/_elements/wrapper, title => "Tracking bugs in SD" &>
<p>It should come as no surprise that we use SD to track bugs in itself.  If you have a running copy of SD, you can create a local clone of the current live database by running:</p>
<blockquote class="code"><pre>SD_REPO=~/sd-bugs sd pull --from http://fsck.com/~jesse/sd-bugs/</pre></blockquote>
%# <p>If the developers have been diligent, you should see a currentish bug list below</p>
