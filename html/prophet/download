<&| /_elements/wrapper, title => 'Get Prophet' &>
<p>At this early stage of the game, you should download Prophet directly from its home in Subversion. The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:</p>
<blockquote class="code">
<pre>svn co http://code.bestpractical.com/bps-public/Prophet/trunk prophet</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you've downloaded Prophet, you can install it:</p>
<blockquote class="code">
<pre>cd prophet
PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the hopefully unlikely event that Prophet doesn't pass its tests, please <a href="/contact">tell the developers about it</a> so we can improve things.
</p>
