<p>Prophet is a new kind of database designed for the post Web-2.0 world. It's made to let you collaborate with your friends and coworkers without needing any kind of special server or internet provider.</p>
<p>What makes Prophet different:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Disconnectable</dt>
<dt>Replicatable</dt>
<dt>Syncable</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Schemaless</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Prophet is flexible enough to be used for all sorts of applications, but we've started with something near and dear to the hearts of most software developers: bug tracking.</p>
<p><a href="/sd">SD</a> is a peer to peer bug tracker which can sync to itself, <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt">RT</a> or <a href="http://hiveminder.com">Hiveminder</a>.  You can extend SD to sync to other bug tracking tools by writing simple adaptors. If you'd like to help make SD work better with your bug tracker, <a href="/contact">drop us a line</a>.</p>
