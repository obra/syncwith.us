<h3>Prophet</h3>
<p>Prophet is a new kind of database designed for the post Web-2.0 world. It's made to let you collaborate with your friends and coworkers without needing any kind of special server or internet provider.</p>

<p>Prophet's buzzword-laden pitch reads something like this:

<blockquote>
A grounded, semirelational, 
peer to peer replicated,
disconnected, versioned,
property database with
self-healing conflict resolution.
</blockquote>
The best place to start learning about Prophet is <a href="/talks">a few recent slides decks and videos</a>.

<h3>SD (Simple Defects)</h3>
<p>Prophet is flexible enough to be used for all sorts of applications, but we've started with something near and dear to the hearts of most software developers: bug tracking.</p>
<p><a href="/sd/using">SD</a> is a peer to peer bug tracking system which we've built to share with just about anything.  <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt">RT</a> and <a href="http://hiveminder.com">Hiveminder</a> are the first two systems we've written adaptors for.  You can extend SD to sync to other bug tracking tools by writing a small bit of code. If can help make SD work better with your bug tracker, <a href="/contact">drop us a line</a>.</p>
